            <h1> Building a safety net for a billion plus households in India.</h1><br>
            </div>
            <p style="color: white">Back in 2008, insurance customers in India were facing a tough time. There was lack of information on products, transparency was missing, mis-selling was rampant, there was a high lapse rate of insurance policies and consumers felt a general apathy towards the insurance industry. Insurance companies made profits from policy surrender charges and the entire industry was mired in murkiness.<br>

                That is when a small bunch of people, with no insurance experience, started re-imagining what the insurance space could be. They imagined a place where consumers could find completely transparent insurance information, and an option to research and compare insurance products so they could buy what they really wanted to. A place where all communications would be recorded so that there would be a clear audit trail of who said what in a product as complex as insurance. A place that provided a common service layer for all consumer services and claims.<br>

                With this grand ambition as their life goal, this motley crew of people started their journey into what is now Policybazaar.com.<br>

                Policybazaar.com is now Indiaâ€™s foremost insurance aggregator and a leading fintech player globally. The objective is the same even today -- Customer First and Sustained Profitability for the entire insurance ecosystem.<br>

                It's a fine balancing act when eight million insurance buyers and 40+ insurers transact a few lac crores of insurance cover and a few thousand crores of insurance premium on a platform with complete confidence every year.<br></p>
