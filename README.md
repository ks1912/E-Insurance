# E-Insurance project review 


In this project we are going to automate the management of insurance activities of an
insurance company. The einsurance firms take entire charge of any such losses against the
payment forfeited every month in the form of premium. EInsurance is a commercial means for
relocating risks and covering fiscal losses. The purpose is to design a system using which users
can perform all activities related to insurance company. E-insurance should reduce internal
administration and management costs by automating business processes, permitting real-time
networking of company departments, and improving management information. It should reduce
the commissions paid to intermediaries since it can be sold directly to clients. For insurance sold
to individuals, agents typically receive a commission of 10 to 15 percent for non-life policy sales
and renewals and from 35 to 100 percent for life insurance policies in the first policy year, but
much lesson renewal. However, some of the income gained in commissions that are not paid to
intermediaries must be spent on online customer acquisition and marketing.
